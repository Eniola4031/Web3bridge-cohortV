// Your contract is supposed to contain a very CRUCIAL function . Your first function accepts 3 different addresses and performs the keccak256 hash of the first 2....it then hashes the result with the third address and returns the final hash...The second CRUCIAL function gets the final hash from the first function above and accepts two arguments(a number and a bytes32 value)...it hashes the number separately, performs a typecasting(on the bytes32[second argument]) so as to convert it to a number, hashes the number too, then hashes both of the resulting hashes with the hash gotten from the previous function and finally returns the final hash
// Note: Use the correct function visibility specifiers
